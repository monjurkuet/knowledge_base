The Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT04321) for the new drug Cardioxil, developed by PharmaCorp, showed promising results in treating hypertension. 
Dr. Emily Carter, the lead investigator at Johns Hopkins University, presented the findings at the Global Cardiology Summit in Zurich on March 15, 2025. 
The study involved 500 patients and demonstrated a 20% reduction in systolic blood pressure compared to the placebo group. 
However, some side effects were noted, including mild nausea and dizziness. 
The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for Cardioxil, with a final decision expected by Q4 2025.
